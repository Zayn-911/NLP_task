This project builds an RNN (LSTM) model for sentiment analysis using the IMDB dataset.
The model learns from labeled movie reviews (positive = 1, negative = 0) and predicts whether a new review expresses positive or negative sentiment.

Dataset: IMDB Movie Reviews
Model Type: RNN with LSTM
Goal: Classify reviews as positive or negative
